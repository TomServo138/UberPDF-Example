# ÜberPDF SDK Example for Lazarus

## My environment

 * Ubuntu 17.10 64 bits
 * Lazarus 1.9.0
 * FPC 3.1.1

## Project Build Options

The only Build Option I'm currently using and testing is the lintel64.

I would apreciate some help in testing lintel32, wintel32 and wintel64 build options.

I'm attempting to make this as complete as possible under my current test environment in terms of the dynamic libraries paths in all relevant places.

I have Lazarus configured with cross-compiling for win32 and win64 but I didn't test the ÜberBuild™ with any Windows versions.

### lintel64

This is the Linux x68_64 (64 bits) configuration.

This is my main playground.

### lintel32

This is the Linux i386 (32 bits) configuration.

### wintel64

This is the Windows 64 bits configuration.

### wintel32

This is the Windows 32 bits configuration.
